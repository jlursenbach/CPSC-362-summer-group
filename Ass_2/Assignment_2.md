## Goals 
• Analysis of customer requirements, writing user requirements, CRC modeling, and class 
or module design, beginning development 
 
## Requirements for this assignment 
1. Analyze all the features of the system specified in the project description document and 
identify all the requirements to implement the features. 
2. Write all the necessary use cases or user stories to implement the feature (a) of the system. 
See assignment #1 for feature (a).  
3. Create all the necessary CRC cards.  
4. Create a class or module diagram. You can use actual paper or a whiteboard to draw the 
diagram. You don’t need to use any UML tool to draw a diagram, although you are welcome 
to do it. 
5. Implement the feature (a) with at least one test case. ** No visual user interface is necessary. ** 
To get the data, use a free package, e.g., “yfinance” in Python, “yahoo-finance” in 
JavaScript, etc., or implement one yourself.  
 
# Acceptance criteria 
A list of all the necessary use cases or user stories and CRC cards in the format discussed in class 
that meet the requirements of all the features for both the user and developers to implement. 
Correct class diagram 
Functional feature (a)
